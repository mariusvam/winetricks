Some games change the screen resolution, but don't change it back on exit.
This is [winehq bug 10841](http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10841).

The command in Linux to set the screen to the default (highest) resolution is '[xrandr](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/maverick/en/man1/xrandr.1.html) -s 0'.

That's easy enough to type, but it's even easier if you
create a little button on the system menu bar to give that command;
here's [a video explaining how to do that on Ubuntu 10.10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ny6w9ivf83I).
