Then, as you're filling out the GSOC application form, please

Please include your name, address, phone number(s), E-mail address,

## Work and Open Source Experience ##
If you're worked in software before, whether at a company or for
an open source project, please name the companies and/or projects,
what languages and operating systems you used, and what you did for
each.

## Your idea ##
If you like one of the ideas we listed, fine, but please
describe it in your own words, with more detail than we gave.
Or if you have your own idea, great.  Either way, please also describe
how you plan to achieve your goal, including a rough timeline
with milestones describing what you will deliver when.

That's it!
