You can get a lot done without knowing much of the syntax of the Unix
shell, but at some point, you'll need to start learning it.
Here are a few resources that might help you get started.

## Tutorials ##

  * "An Introduction to the Unix Shell", S. R. Bourne, 1978 ([PDF](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis191/assignments/bourne-shell.pdf), [HTML](http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~buja/STAT-540/shell-Bourne-An-Introduction-to-the-Unix-Shell.htm)) - is a simple introduction to the fundamentals.  The language was simpler then, but it's still worth reading.
  * ["Portable Shell Programming"](http://www.amazon.com/Portable-Shell-Programming-Extensive-Collection/dp/0134514947) by Bruce Blinn.  Excellent, slim book.  Worth buying used, you should be able to get it for $10

## Reference ##
  * [Current POSIX shell standard](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/xcu_chap02.html) - this is the final word on what's allowed
