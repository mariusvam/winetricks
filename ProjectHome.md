Winetricks is an easy way to work around problems in [Wine](http://winehq.org).

It has a menu of supported games/apps for which it can do all the workarounds automatically.
It also lets you install missing DLLs or tweak various Wine settings individually.

It can be used via gui or commandline, whichever you prefer; the commandline mode is particularly useful as a building block in fancier wine frontends and in automated regression testing.
